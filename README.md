# GOV PL Info

**GOV PL Info** is a project initiated on April 1, 2021. The main goal 
of this project is to provide informations send by Polish Government in 
a form of mobile notifications. This has been easily achieved by use of 
[Telegram Channels](https://telegram.org/tour/channels) which can have 
an unlimited amount of subscribers. Since the source of information is 
provided in polish language, all notifications are being send in polish 
language, however in addition they are automatically translated into 
english language by use of Google Translate service which should make a 
life of foreigners in Poland a little bit easier.
